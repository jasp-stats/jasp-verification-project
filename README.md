# JASP Verification Project

## Aim

This document contains the verification of the results computed in JASP. For this purpose, the same statistical tests have been performed on the same datasets, using other popular statistical software packages (SPSS, SAS, Minitab, R) and hand calculations.
This repository contains the R-Markdown files that document the verification process. 

These Markdown files are automatically knitted to html files and deployed as a GitHub page: https://jasp-stats.github.io/jasp-verification-project/.

## Contributing

- If you want to update the output for a test or add verification for an additional test you will only need to edit the corrosponding .Rmd files or create a new .Rmd file. 
- If you need to replace screenshots or add additional ones, they can be found in the 'Screenshots' folder. 
- The same holds for datasets, which can be found in the 'Datasets' folder. 
- You will not have to knit the .Rmd files to html, this is done automatically by GitHub Actions.

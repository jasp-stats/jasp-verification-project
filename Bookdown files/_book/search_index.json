Among the studies carried out was one done with orphans, who were compared with nonorphaned children on the basis of the judged size of parental figures viewed at a distance. []Now two independent randomly selected groups were used. Sample 1 was a group of orphaned children without foster parents. Sample 2 was a group of children having a normal family with both parents. Both population of children sampled showed the same age level, sex distribution, educational level, and so forth. The question asked by the experimenter was Do deprived children tend to judge the parental figures relatively larger than do the nondeprived? In terms of a null and alternative hypothesis, H0: \\(\\mu\\)1 - \\(\\mu\\)2 \\(\\le 0\\) H1: \\(\\mu\\)1 - \\(\\mu\\)2 \\(&gt; 0\\). The \\(\\alpha\\) level for significance decided upon was .05. The actual results were Sample 1: M1 = 1.8 S1 = .7 N1 = 125 Sample 2: M2 = 1.6 S2 = .9 N2 = 150 Note: A data set with these properties has been simulated using R. 3.1.1 Results Overview Table 3.1: Result Overview Independent Samples T-Test By Hand JASP SPSS SAS Minitab R t (Welch) 2.11 2.0717 2.072 2.07 2.07 2.0717 t (Student) NA 2.0257 2.026 2.03 2.03 2.0257 3.1.2 By Hand Calculations by hand can be found in Hays, 1974, pp. 404-407.

The output for the Mann-Whitney test is not clearly defined, leading to different conventions in different software. The R documentation explains it as follows: The two most common definitions correspond to the sum of the ranks of the first sample with the minimum value subtracted or not: R subtracts and S-PLUS does not, giving a value which is larger by m(m+1)/2 for a first sample of size m. (It seems Wilcoxons original paper used the unadjusted sum of the ranks but subsequent tables subtracted the minimum.) Rs value can also be computed as the number of all pairs (x[i], y[j]) for which y[j] is not greater than x[i], the most common definition of the Mann-Whitney test. 3.2.9 References Hays, W. L.

New York, US: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. 3.3 Paired Samples T-Test An example from Hays (1974, pp. 424-427): Consider once again the question of scores on a test of dominance. The basic question has to do with the mean score for men as opposed to the mean score for women. In carrying out the experiment, the investigator decided to sample eight husband-wife-pairs at random. The members of each pair were given the test of dominance separately, and the data turned out as follows: Table 3.4: Data for Paired Sample T-Test Husband Wife 26 30 28 29 28 28 29 27 30 26 31 25 34 24 37 23 3.3.1 Results Overview Table 3.5: Result Overview Paired Samples T-Test By Hand JASP SPSS SAS Minitab R t 1.838 1.8381 1.838 1.84 1.84 1.8381 3.3.2 By Hand Calculations by hand can be found in Hays, 1974, pp. 424-427.

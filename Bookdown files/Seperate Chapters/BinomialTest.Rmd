## Binomial Test

### Example 
An example from Hays (1974, pp. 190-192): 


"Think of a hypothetical study of this question: 'If a human is subjected to a stimulus below his threshold of conscious awareness, can his behavior somehow still be influenced by the presence of the stimulus?' The experimental task is as follows: the subject is seated in a room in front of a square screen divided into four equal parts. He is instructed that his task is to guess in which part of the screen a small, very faint, spot of light is thrown." 


Under the null hypothesis H~0~, the number of correct guesses is expected to be 1/4 of the trials N. The alternative hypothesis H~1~ is that the number of correct guesses is larger than 1/4 of the trials N. 

The subject obtained 7 correct guesses T out of 10 trials N. 

What is the p-value of this result under H~0~?

p = 0.25 

N = 10

T = 7


### Results Overview

```{r echo=F}
ResultsBinomial <- matrix(c(0.0035,0.0035, 0.004, 0.0035, 0.004, 0.0035), ncol=6)
colnames(ResultsBinomial) <- c('By Hand', 'JASP', 'SPSS', 'SAS', 'Minitab', 'R')
rownames(ResultsBinomial) <- c('P')
knitr::kable(head(ResultsBinomial, 20), caption = "Result Overview Binomial Test", booktabs = T)
```



### By Hand

Calculations by hand can be found in Hays, 1974, pp. 190-192.

Result: P = 0.0035



### JASP
```{r BinomialTestJASP, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:BinomialTestJASP}JASP Output for Binomial Test"}
knitr::include_graphics('Screenshots/Binomial Test/BinomialTestJASP.PNG')
```


### SPSS

```{R eval=F}

DATASET NAME DataSet1 WINDOW=FRONT. 
*Nonparametric Tests: One Sample. 
NPTESTS 
  /ONESAMPLE TEST (Guesses) BINOMIAL(TESTVALUE=0.25 SUCCESSCATEGORICAL=FIRST SUCCESSCONTINUOUS=CUTPOINT(MIDPOINT)) 
  /MISSING SCOPE=ANALYSIS USERMISSING=EXCLUDE 
  /CRITERIA ALPHA=0.05 CILEVEL=95.

```


```{r BinomialTestSPSS, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:BinomialTestSPSS}SPSS Output for Binomial Test"}
knitr::include_graphics('Screenshots/Binomial Test/BinomialTestSPSS.PNG')
```

### SAS

```{R eval=F}

PROC Freq data=WORK.IMPORT;
	tables Guesses / binomial(p=.25 level=2);
	exact binomial;
run;

```


```{r BinomialTestSAS, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:BinomialTestSAS}SAS Output for Binomial Test"}
knitr::include_graphics('Screenshots/Binomial Test/BinomialTestSAS.PNG')
```

### Minitab


```{r BinomialTestMinitab, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:BinomialTestMinitab}Minitab Output for Binomial Test"}
knitr::include_graphics('Screenshots/Binomial Test/BinomialTestMinitab.PNG')
```

### R

```{r}
binom.test(7, 10, p = 0.25, alternative = "greater")
```

### Remarks

All differences in results between the software and hand calculation are due to rounding.
